# Docker Networking & Volumes

Containers are ephemeral; your data shouldn't be.

## Volumes & Persistence
- **Named Volumes**: Managed by Docker, best for databases and persistent app state.
- **Bind Mounts**: Direct host-to-container mapping, best for development code.

## Internal Networking
- **User-Defined Bridges**: Created isolated networks for containers to talk to each other via service names (DNS).
- **Aliases**: Give containers multiple network identities.

## Best Practices
- **External Networks**: Avoid using the default "bridge" network for production.
- **Volume Backups**: Regularly back up persistent volumes.
