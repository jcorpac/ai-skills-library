# UI Search & Filtering

With 80+ skills, users need to find exactly what they need in milliseconds.

## Implementation Patterns
- **Index Generation**: Create a JSON index containing titles, tags, and small snippets of every skill.
- **Fuzzy Search**: Use a library like `Fuse.js` or `FlexSearch` for tolerant, high-performance querying.

## Interaction Design
- **Real-time Results**: Trigger search on every keystroke (`input` event).
- **Result Highlight**: Visually highlight the matching terms in the result cards.

## Best Practices
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Allow users to focus and navigate search results using arrow keys and Enter.
- **Zero Results State**: Provide a clear "No skills found" message with suggestions.
