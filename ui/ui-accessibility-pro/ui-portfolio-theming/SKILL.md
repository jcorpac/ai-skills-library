# UI Portfolio Theming

A skill library should feel premium, focusing on typography, layout, and visual clarity.

## Design Systems
- **Typography First**: Use high-quality Google Fonts (e.g., *Inter*, *Outfit*) and ensure generous line-heights.
- **Color Palettes**: Use sophisticated slate, navy, or deep charcoal tones rather than pure black.

## Visual Flourishes
- **Glassmorphism**: Use `backdrop-filter: blur()` and subtle border-colors for a modern, layered feel.
- **Micro-interactions**: Subtle hover offsets and transitions for links and cards.

## Best Practices
- **Dark Mode Support**: Always implement a cohesive dark theme.
- **Responsive Hierarchy**: Ensure complex documentation remains readable on mobile devices.
