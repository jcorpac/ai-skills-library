# Meta-Skill Routing

When a library has dozens of skills, you cannot load them all. You must "route" your attention effectively.

## The Two-Step Pattern
1.  **Index Lookup**: Read the root `README.md` or a dedicated index to identify which skills are relevant to the current request.
2.  **Explicit Load**: Only load the content of the specific `SKILL.md` files needed.

## Routing Heuristics
- **Keyword Matching**: Look for domain-specific keywords (e.g., "Flask", "TDD", "Transformers").
- **Intent Discovery**: Ask, "Is this a planning, implementing, or verifying task?" and route to the corresponding skill suite.

## Best Practices
- **Atomic Loading**: Avoid "just in case" loading. Only load a skill when you are about to perform an action related to it.
- **Reference Over Inclusion**: Link to skills in documentation instead of copying their content.
