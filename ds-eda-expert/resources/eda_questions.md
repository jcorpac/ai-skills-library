# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Critical Questions

## 📂 Data Overview
- [ ] What is the shape of the data? (Rows vs Columns)
- [ ] What are the data types? (Numerical, Categorical, Datetime)
- [ ] Are there missing values? Are they random or systematic?
- [ ] Are there duplicate records?

## 📊 Univariate Analysis
- [ ] What is the distribution of each numerical feature? (Skews, Outliers)
- [ ] What are the frequencies of categorical values?
- [ ] Are there any "hidden" missing values? (e.g., 0 used as null)

## 🔗 Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis
- [ ] How do features correlate with the target variable?
- [ ] Is there multi-collinearity between features?
- [ ] Are there interesting clusters or groupings in the data?

## 🧠 Domain Specifics
- [ ] Does the data align with business logic?
- [ ] Are there time-based trends or seasonality?
- [ ] Are there outliers that are actually valid (but rare) events?
