# Knowledge Base Architect

A knowledge base is where the "tribal knowledge" of a project is recorded and organized.

## Structure
- **Technical Lore**: How the magic works. Deep dives into complex systems.
- **Onboarding Guide**: What a new developer needs on day one.
- **Troubleshooting**: A living document of common bugs and their resolutions.
- **Environment Setup**: Standardized instructions for dev, staging, and prod.

## Onboarding Checklist
- [ ] Access to repo.
- [ ] Required tools (Docker, Go, Node, etc.).
- [ ] Local env vars / secrets.
- [ ] First "Good First Issue" assignment.

## Best Practices
- **Searchable**: Use tags and descriptive titles.
- **Accessible**: Place it in the repo (as a `docs/` folder) or a linked Wiki.
- **Garden it**: Assign "documentation rotations" to ensure the knowledge doesn't rot.
