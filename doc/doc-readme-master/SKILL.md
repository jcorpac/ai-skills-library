# README Master

A README is the "front door" of your project. It should tell users exactly what the project is, how to use it, and why they should care.

## Anatomy of a Great README

### 1. Header & Quick Links
- Project Name & One-sentence purpose.
- Badges (Build, Coverage, Status).
- Quick links to Demo, Docs, or Installation.

### 2. Overview
- More detailed description of the problem solved and core features.

### 3. Installation
- Step-by-step instructions for getting started.
- Prerequisite list.

### 4. Usage
- Code snippets or screenshots showing how to actually use the tool.

### 5. API / Documentation
- Brief overview of core components or link to formal documentation.

### 6. Contributing & License
- Guide for developers to contribute and the legal permissions.

## Best Practices
- **Use Visuals**: Screenshots, terminal recordings, and diagrams (Mermaid) make a README stand out.
- **Keep it Updated**: A stale README is worse than no README.
- **Provide Copy-Pasteable Blocks**: Make it easy for users to get started.
