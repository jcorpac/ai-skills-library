# ML Deep Learning Foundations

Deep learning powers complex vision and sequence tasks.

## Core Components
- **Architectures**: CNNs (Vision), RNNs/LSTMs (Sequences), Transformers (Everything).
- **Optimizers**: Adam, SGD, RMSprop.
- **Loss Functions**: CrossEntropy (Classification), MSE (Regression).

## Advanced Patterns
- **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tuning pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, BERT).
- **Regularization**: Dropout, Batch Normalization, and Weight Decay.
- **Early Stopping**: Preventing overfitting by monitoring validation loss.

## Frameworks
- **PyTorch**: Researcher favorite, highly dynamic.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: Mature ecosystem, production-ready.
