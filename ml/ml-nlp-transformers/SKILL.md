# ML NLP Transformers

Transformers changed everything. This skill focuses on the Hugging Face ecosystem.

## The Pipeline
1.  **Tokenization**: Converting text to numbers.
2.  **Model Loading**: Using `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` or similar.
3.  **Training / Fine-Tuning**: Using the `Trainer` API for simplicity.

## Core Tasks
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Understanding emotion.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extracting entities (People, Places).
- **Summarization**: Condensing text.
- **Embeddings**: Creating vector representations for semantic search.

## Best Practices
- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**: Using LoRA to adapt large models with minimal resources.
- **Quantization**: Compressing models for faster inference.
