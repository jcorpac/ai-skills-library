# ML Training Abstractions

Writing training loops from scratch is error-prone. Abstractions allow you to focus on the model architecture and data.

## PyTorch Lightning
- **The LightningModule**: Decouple the system (architecture, optimization) from the data.
- **The Trainer**: Automate loops, checkpointing, logging, and GPU/TPU distribution.
- **Callbacks**: Add custom logic (e.g., Early Stopping) without polluting the main loop.

## Keras
- **Sequential vs Functional API**: Choosing the right level of complexity.
- **Model.fit()**: The power of a single line for training.
- **Custom Layers**: Building complex logic while maintaining the high-level API.

## Best Practices
- **Consistency**: Use these frameworks to ensure reproducible research and production code.
- **Monitoring**: Always integrate with a logger (e.g., TensorBoard, MLflow).
