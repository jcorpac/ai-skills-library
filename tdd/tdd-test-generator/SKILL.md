# TDD Test Generator

This skill focuses on creating robust test suites quickly.

## Principles
- **Boilerplate First**: Get the basic setup out of the way.
- **Exhaustive Edge Cases**: Consider nulls, empty strings, large numbers, and boundary conditions.
- **Table-Driven Tests**: Use data tables for repeatable test logic.

## Recommended Prompts
"Generate a pytest test suite for the following function, including edge cases for empty inputs and invalid types: [code snippet]"

## Templates
Check `resources/templates/` for starting points in Python and JavaScript.
