# TDD Cycle Manager

This skill helps maintain the discipline of the TDD cycle.

## The Cycle

### 1. 🔴 RED (Write a failing test)
- Focus on the *behavior* you want to implement.
- Write a minimal test that fails (compile error or assertion failure).
- **Goal**: Confirm the test fails for the right reason.

### 2. 🟢 GREEN (Make it pass)
- Write the *minimal* amount of code to make the test pass.
- Don't worry about aesthetics or performance yet.
- **Goal**: Get to a passing state as quickly as possible.

### 3. 🔵 REFACTOR (Clean up)
- Improve the code without changing its behavior.
- Use the tests as a safety net.
- **Goal**: Enhance readability, remove duplication, and optimize.

## Usage
Use the provided `scripts/check_phase.py` to analyze your current test results and determine your next step.
