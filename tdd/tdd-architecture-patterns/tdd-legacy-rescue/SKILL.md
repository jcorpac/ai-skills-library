# Legacy Code Rescue

"Legacy code is code without tests." — Michael Feathers

## Rescue Strategies

### 1. Sprout Method / Class
- When you need to add functionality, write it as new, tested code (a "sprout") and call it from the legacy code.
- **Benefit**: Ensures new code is tested immediately.

### 2. Wrap Method / Class
- Wrap an existing method or class with a new one that contains the new logic and calls the original.
- **Benefit**: Provides a clear boundary for testing new behavior.

### 3. Breaking Dependencies
- Identify "Seams" (places where you can change behavior without editing code in that place).
- Use Dependency Injection or Subclass & Override to isolate the logic you want to test.

## The Rescue Cycle
1. Identify a target for change.
2. Find a Seam and break dependencies.
3. Write a characterization test (to document current behavior).
4. Apply your change using TDD.
5. Refactor with the safety of your new tests.
