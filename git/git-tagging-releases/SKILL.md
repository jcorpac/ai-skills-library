# Git Tagging & Releases

Tags are pointers to specific points in your repository's history, typically used to mark release versions.

## Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `2.3.1`)
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes.
- **MINOR**: New features (backwards compatible).
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backwards compatible).

## Tagging Types
- **Lightweight Tags**: Just a pointer to a commit.
- **Annotated Tags**: Stored as full objects in the Git database. They include the tagger's name, email, and date. **Best practice for releases.**

## Automation
Use tools like `standard-version` or `semantic-release` to:
1.  Analyze commit messages (Conventional Commits).
2.  Bump the version number.
3.  Create a Git tag.
4.  Generate an automated `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Value
Provides clear milestones for deployment and allows users to depend on specific versions of your software.
